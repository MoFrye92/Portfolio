# 👋 Hi, I'm Mo Frye

Welcome to my portfolio repo! I'm a tech-driven creative who enjoys building useful, clean, and user-focused digital projects. My background blends front-end development, data analysis, and ERP/SAP support — so I tend to work at the intersection of people, systems, and problem-solving.

This space is where I share some of the work I’ve built (or am building) as I continue growing my skills and exploring new areas in tech.

## 🧠 What I Work With

- **Front-End Development:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Python & Data Analysis:** Data cleaning, transformation, reporting, and automation  
- **ERP & Systems Support / SAP:** Access Enforcer, WFM, ICAM, documentation & process support  

I enjoy learning new tools and finding practical ways to apply them — whether that’s improving a process, creating something helpful, or just experimenting with an idea.
